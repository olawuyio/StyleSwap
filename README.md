# StyleSwap
People have clothes they’re not wearing anymore (usually 80% of their wardrobe) and they want to donate it to someone/ share it with someone in their community.

Today, less than 20% of clothing donations made to charities are actually resold there, with the rest going to recycling facilities, from which they then go to landfills. Clothes that end up in landfills takes years to decompose and at the rate we produce clothing waste (with fast fashion), this is more accurately centuries. Additionally, when we donate, people often don’t need/ want the donations and the clothes go from being unused in one closet to being unused somewhere else.

Process:
1. The user takes a picture of the item and puts it on the app. It joins their clothing database and the overall community database. If they buy it online, it is automatically be added to the database.
2. Users get to choose whether they want to make any of the clothes in their database as visible or invisible (to the community).
2. Then when someone borrows the item, the item is unavailable to the original user and shows up in the borrower's database once the exchange has been approved by the lender.
3. The borrower and lender can agree on an exchange period and exchange credits accordingly.
5. The users can set alerts for certain time periods to check when they have not used a clothing item, making them evaluate if they should swap or donate the item, or it can serve as a reminder to wear it.
6. They also get alerts when they update/ borrow item that are similar to ones they already own (notifying them about their habits).
